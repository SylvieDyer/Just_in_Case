Just In Case User Manual

## 1.0 General Information
Just in Case is an application meant to help CWRU students plan for their day in advance by allowing them to post and receive updates on what’s happening on Campus. 

## 1.1 System Overview
The Just In Case Application is divided into two main sections, the Live Feed and the Building Hub. It opens up with a login page for CWRU users or admin, taking in their case email in the format abc123@case.edu and a password from the user. 


## 1.2 Access instructions:
*To access the website as admin, you can use the following credentials:*

Email: srd119@case.edu

Password: admin!23

*To access as non-admin, use the following credentials:*

Email: abc123@case.edu

Password: pass!23


## 1.3 User Functionality

### User Registration:
Upon entering their case e-mail and password, if the user does not have an account, they will be prompted to create one and add a username to their account. With these credentials, they can log into the page as a user.

### Application setup:
Upon logging in, users will see a split screen containing the Live Feed on the left and the Building Hub on the right. Users also have the option to log out by pressing a button on the top right side of the screen labeled “Log Out”

### Live Feed:
The live feed contains posts made by users in the format:
``` New Alert!
Reports of “POST_TYPE” at “LOCATION"
		Posted by: User ID or Anonymous
		at MM/DD/YYY @00:00 
```

This way, each live feed post contains information about the location being reported, the type of the post, such as “EXCESSIVE_RAIN” or “SNOW” or “SUSPICIOUS_BEHAVIOR”, the user who posted it (although at the moment all user posts are set to be anonymous) and the date and time of the post.
